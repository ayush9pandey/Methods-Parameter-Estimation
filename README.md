# Parameter-Methods-Estimation

## Introduction: 
These research simulations are derived from the paper titled "Online Parameters Estimation Methods for Adaptive Cruise Control Systems" by Wang et al. [Research Paper](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03011790/file/wang-gunter-nice-dellemonache-work-2020.pdf)
. In adaptive cruise systems, there are various challenges when it comes to predicting future states of velocities given some parameters, distances, space gaps, velocities, etc. This GitHub repository attempts to model and simulate the findings and results to conduct furhter analysis on the methods presented. 

## Methodology: 
Based off the paper, there exists two primary methods they use to approach to tackle this problem. 
1. Particle Filtering
2. Recursive Least Squres
