# Parameter-Methods-Estimation

## Introduction: 
These research simulations are derived from the paper titled "Online Parameters Estimation Methods for Adaptive Cruise Control Systems" by Wang et al. https://inria.hal.science/hal-03011790/file/wang-gunter-nice-dellemonache-work-2020.pdf
In adaptive cruise systems, there are various challenges when it comes to predicting future states of velocities given some parameters, distances, space gaps, velocities, etc. This GitHub repository attempts to model and simulate
